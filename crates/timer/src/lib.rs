#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! Timeouts and intervals for widgets, on the ring: no threads, no
//! async runtime, and an idle app sleeps until its next timer is due.
//!
//! # Model
//!
//! - A widget *defines* its timers in [`Widget::build`] through
//!   [`SpawnerTimers`]: `set_timeout` and `set_interval` start right away,
//!   `add_timeout` and `add_interval` register stopped. Each is an
//!   `on::<Timeout>` handler on the node being built that runs only for
//!   its own timer, and each returns a [`TimerId`] the widget keeps.
//! - Its handlers *control* them through [`ContextTimers`]: start (a
//!   running timer restarts from now), start with a new duration, cancel,
//!   ask whether running. A handler cannot register a timer: handlers
//!   are only ever added at build, so starting a timer a thousand times
//!   adds nothing.
//! - A timer's deadline is the truth and it has at most one ring timeout
//!   in flight. A restart that moves the deadline later keeps that op,
//!   which re-arms for the rest when it completes early; only a deadline
//!   moved earlier, or a cancel, leaves an op stale, dropped when it
//!   completes.
//! - When a deadline comes, [`Timeout`] is emitted at the owner node. An
//!   interval re-arms from the fire, so a late fire shifts the rest later
//!   and never fires twice to catch up.
//! - A timer lives as long as its node: removing the node drops it, and
//!   an id kept past that is a quiet no-op returning `false`.
//! - [`TimerModule`] installs after `RingModule`. Ops are submitted on
//!   `BeforeWait`, so a timer started in a tick is armed before the
//!   runner blocks.
